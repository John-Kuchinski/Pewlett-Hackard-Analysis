# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Using to SQL to assist in preparations for retiring employees
## Overview
In this project we assisted Pewlett-Hackard in identifying the employees that are getting ready to reach the age of retirement. We created muliple queries in order to help locate those that will be eligible for a mentorship program once the "Silver Tsunami" hits the shores of their business.
## Results
### Deliverable 1 (Retirement title table)
Our first table shows the number of employees by department getting ready to retire

Using the tables above and the queries that were requested we can see a few things
* 1. There are a large amount of employees getting ready to retire, with your most being in Senior Engineering or in Senior Staff.
* 2. With the large desparirty in the quantity of employees retiring these titles should take the highest priority in mentoring or rehiring in these positions.
* 3. Among those that are retiring which is 72,548, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.
* 4. With this information we see that we will have more retiring than those eligible for the mentorship, this means that you will more than likely need to have multiple trained underneath one mentor in order to cover that large of a difference
## Summary
A potential route that could be suggested is to do an additional query to determine the number of people retiring by year, this will give additional insight into which positions need to take priority by year. This will allow for the task to be more managable as the deadlines approach for each given year. This will also help to determine best options dependent on requirements of each role for hiring purposes, whether it is best to train from within or to hire from outside the cmopany.
The next query that would be suggested is to break down employees of are elligible to be mentored as well as those eligible to be the mentor and break it down by title.  This hsould give you a more precise list in order to work on getting the proper mentor and mentee to give you the best overall outcome from the mentorship program and ensure that the company continues runnning efiiciently.
